<h1 align="center">Visual Credit Card UI</h1>

## Description
> This project is an interactive visual credit card interface that simulates real-time data entry. 

> As the user completes the form, the information is dynamically updated on the virtual card, reflecting the number, cardholder, expiration date, and CVV. It also incorporates fluid animations, such as rotating the card upon entering the CVV to reveal the back of the card. 

> It uses <i>HTML</i> for structure, <i>Tailwind CSS</i> for responsive design and styling, and <i>JavaScript</i> to manage events, animations, and dynamic interface updates. This system is designed to offer an engaging visual experience and can be integrated into payment platforms or applications that require interactive credit card representation.
